	* Add some error checking for the NSEC3 command line parameters
	for jdnssec-signzone.

	* Update local dnsjava build to 2.0.1.

	* Modified the jdnssec-* shell wrappers to also use the local
	build area version of the jdnssec-tools.jar file.  This allows the
	standard jdnssec-* wrappers to work right from the build area.

	* Add support of the SHA256 algorithm for DS records.

	* Change the name of the package and jar file to jdnssec-tools
	(from java-dnssec-tools) for consistency.

	* release version 0.7.0.

2006-05-23  David Blacka  <davidb@verisignlabs.com>

	* Add support for algorithm aliases.  This feature is so that the
	user can declare the DNSKEY algorithm x is the same as algorithm 5
	(e.g.).  So far, this only works with straight integer algorithm
	identifiers (no private alg support yet).

	* Fix jdnssec-signzone so that you can specify multiple KSKs on
	the command line.  Apparently, commons-cli actually does handle
	repeating command line options correctly.

2006-05-03  David Blacka  <davidb@verisignlabs.com>

	* Add preliminary implementation of jdnssec-dstool.  This is a
	simple command line tool that takes a DNSKEY record and converts
	it into a DS record (or a DLV record).  Right now, it requires
	that the key is stored in a file ending with '.key'.

	* release version 0.6.0.

2006-03-15  David Blacka  <davidb@verisignlabs.com>

	* Type map changes for NSEC3, corresponding to changes in draft
	-05pre.  Essentially: NSEC3 and RRSIG bits are not set for most
	(all) NSEC3 records any longer.

2006-03-06  David Blacka  <davidb@verisignlabs.com>

	* release version 0.5.0.

2006-02-16  David Blacka  <davidb@verisignlabs.com>

	* Make RecordComparator also compare RDATA so the removeDuplicates
	step actually works reliabled.  This was masked by the dupicate
	suppression in org.xbill.DNS.RRset.

	* Only allow one command line specified KSK since commons-cli
	doesn't seem to handle multi-arg options correctly.

	* Do not croak on the lack of the command-line keys for now.

	* New version of local dnsjava build containing NSEC3 changes
	corresponding to the -04pre draft.

2005-11-16  David Blacka  <davidb@verisignlabs.com>

	* Make jdnssec-verifyzone work with just the zone (which is
	self-signed anyway).

	* release version 0.4.2.

2005-11-09  David Blacka  <davidb@verisignlabs.com>

	* Add original ownername comments to the NSEC3 generation.

2005-11-08  David Blacka  <davidb@verisignlabs.com>

	* New zone formatter.

	* Misc bug fixes.

	* release version 0.4.1.

2005-11-07  David Blacka  <davidb@verisignlabs.com>

	* Update the local dnsjava build with a bugfix.

	* Fix ordering problem with ProtoNSEC3s.

2005-11-06  David Blacka  <davidb@verisignlabs.com>

	* Actually use the --iterations command line option of
	jdnssec-signzone.

2005-10-27  David Blacka  <davidb@verisignlabs.com>

	* Add NSEC3 support for jdnssec-signzone.

	* Remove support for plain Opt-In (until private algorithms work).

	* release version 0.4.0.

2005-08-14  David Blacka  <davidb@verisignlabs.com>

	* Move the signZone function into the SignZone class (from the
	SignUtils) class.

	* General cleanup.

	* Add local _jdnssec-* shell wrappers.  These use build/classes in
	the classpath so can be used to run the tools right out of the
	build area.

2005-08-13  David Blacka  <davidb@verisignlabs.com>

	* Update to DNSjava 2.0.0

	* Refactor command line parsing.

	* Switch to using java.util.logging for logging.
