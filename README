This is a collection of DNSSEC tools written in Java.  They are
intended to be an addition or replacement for the DNSSEC tools that
are part of BIND 9.

These tools depend upon DNSjava (http://www.xbill.org/dnsjava), the
Jakarta Commons CLI and Logging libraries (http://jakarta.apache.org),
and Sun's Java Cryptography extensions.  A copy of each of these
libraries is included in the distribution.

See the "licenses" directory for the licensing information of this
package and the other packages that are distributed with it.

Getting started:

1. unpack the binary distribution:

% tar zxvf java-dnssec-tools-x.x.x.tar.gz

2. run the various tools from their unpacked location:

% cd java-dnssec-tools-x.x.x
% ./bin/signZone.sh -h

Building from source:

1. unpack the source distribution, preferably into the same directory
that the binary distribution was unpacked.

% tar zxvf java-dnssec-tools-x.x.x-src.tar.gz

2. edit the build.properties file to suit your environment,
particularly the use of the jikes compiler.

2. run Ant (see http://jakara.apache.org for information about the Ant
build tool).
